In this chapter we will evaluate the architectures described in chapter \ref{chapter:architectures} with the method described in chapter \ref{chapter:design_of_experiments}. Some of them will additionally be evaluated with the implementation from chapter \ref{chapter:implementation}.

% eg: MCC aims to have offloading invisble by users, this enforeces this and that dist transparency.


\section{Multi-Access Edge Computing}
In MEC, they seek to offload a reasonable amount of work. Therefore, we will not offload all the work, but rather test with several ratios of computation offloading.
% test med 100% offload, 50% offload osv
%\begin{itemize}
 %   \item Easily scalable as we have the common interface. This makes it easy to add more vms to run more apps. So, its horizontally scalable?
%\end{itemize}


% \section{Mobile Cloud computing}

% \subsection{Computation}% move this over to evaluation?
% In MCC most of the computation will be done on the closest server. This is because MCC aims to have as little as possible computation on the mobile device to conserve computation, storage and most importantly, energy.

% \subsection{storage}% move this over to evaluation?
% MCC will have little storage offloading. The device itself might have little storage, but in todays society most of them have enough local storage for what they need to do. However, in some cases there might be need for storage offloading.
