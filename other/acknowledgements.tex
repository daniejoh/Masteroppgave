\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
%This thesis was made in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was tough to keep motivated during these scary and isolated times. I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Eric Jul for invaluable help. This thesis would not have been possible without you. I would like to thank my mom, dad and several friends and co-students for helping me keep my head up and motivating me to see this through. Thank you to my co-student and roommate, who helped keep spirits high and motivating me. A big thanks to my brother who is always there for me when I need it. A special thank you to my wonderful girlfriend who helped me through this though time as well as proofreading. Thank you all so much.
